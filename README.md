# odin-recipes
Repo to hold code belonging to https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes

When you run this code in a web browser, you should ideally see a recipe website. It won't be very pretty yet (since this will by HTML only, no CSS) but I can assure you the recipes will be worth trying out.
