        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>I don't remember who taught me this recipe. What I do know is that it never fails to please those who try it. Lasagna is always
            a crowd pleaser but what makes this version so special is a layer of sour cream and spinach which replaces the more traditional bechamel layer.
            I love it, my partner and kids love it and I'm sure your tastebuds will love it too!

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Frozen Spinach (500g)</li>
            <li>Sour Cream (220g)</li>
            <li>Mince Meat (700g)</li>
            <li>Tomato Passata (500g)</li>
            <li>Chopped Tomatoes (400g)</li>
            <li>White Onion (1)</li>
            <li>Garlic (4 cloves)</li>
            <li>Grated Cheddar (300g)</li>
            <li>Lasagna Sheets (18-20)</li>
            <li>Smoked Paprika Powder</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to gas mark 6 / 200 degrees celcius. </li>
            <li>Fry chopped onions until they're translucent (+- 10 mins). Add chopped garlic for the last few minutes and then remove from the pan.</li>
            <li>Heat the pan at the highest possible temperature and then fry the mince meat for a few minutes. Fry in batches to make sure the meat does not cook.</li>
            <li>Add onion & garlic to the fried meat. Also throw in paprika powder, salt & pepper and mix well.</li>
            <li>Add chopped tomatoes & tomato passata to the pan and cook for a minute or two. Add some sugar to the sauce if it is too sour.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile in another pan or pot, defreeze the Spinach.</li>
            <li>When the Spinach is not frozen anymore, mix it with the sour cream and add salt & pepper.</li>
            <li>In a baking tray, put a layer of your tomato-meat-onion sauce. Cover with grated cheddar and then add lasagna sheets on top of the cheese.</li>
            <li>Next spread a layer of the spinach-sour-cream sauce. Do not put cheese on this; immediately cover with more lasagna sheets.</li>
            <li>Finally add another layer of tomato-meat-onion sauce and top it up with more grated cheddar.</li>
            <li>Place the baking tray in the oven and bake for 40 minutes. After 40 minutes it's ready to eat; enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
