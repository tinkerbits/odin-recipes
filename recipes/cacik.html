        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>In a past life I lived in a Turkish city called Izmir for a good 10 months. Being used to the gray drizzly weather of northern Europe, it took me some time to get used to the summer weather in Izmir, which can be described as '40 degrees and sun all day every day'.
            The citizens of Izmir did not seem to suffer all that much from this heat however. Over time I learnt some of their tricks in dealing with the high temperatures. And by far my favourite was this little yoghurt soup called Cacık.</p>
        <p>Cacık is a soup which consists of only a few ingredients (so its easy to whip up quickly). On a hot day it is absolutely refreshing, though I even make it on colder days since it's simply so yummy. Read on to learn how to make this soup yourself!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Turkish (or Greek) Yoghurt (1kg)</li>
            <li>Galic (5 cloves)</li>
            <li>Cucumber (1)</li>
            <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil (50ml)</li>
            <li>Fresh Mint Leaves (100g)</li>
            <li>Ice Cubes</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel and cut the cucumber into very small pieces.</li>
            <li>Press the garlic cloves.</li>
            <li>Chop the mint leaves into thin slices, but save a few for decoration.</li>
            <li>Mix cucumber, garlic & mint leaves together in a big bowl. Add all of the yoghurt to the bowl and mix again.</li>
            <li>Add half a litre of cold water.</li>
            <li>Add salt to taste (Cacık should taste a bit salty).</li>
            <li>Decorate with a few good guzzles of olive oil (or if your name is Marco Pierre White, a few drops of olive oil).</li>
            <li>Throw in a few ice cubes and, after serving in plates, top up with the remaining mint leaves.</li>
        </ol>
